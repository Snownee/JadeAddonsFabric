# JadeAddonsFabricWithMTR
Hello. This is a fork of Jade Addons Fabric. Adding some fixes for the Minecraft Transit Railway.
I will try to keep this updated but its not a priority.

## Fixes/Additions
- Fixes the invisible entity that MTR has.
- Adds info for what direction a Esculator is going. (Up, Down, North, South, East, West)

## Installation
Download this fork and just add it into the mod folder with Jade.
